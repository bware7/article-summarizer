# Final Project: Article Summarizer
## Bin Ware

In this project, I have applied web mining and natural language processing techniques to extract and summarize an online article. Specifically, I:

1. Selected a Wikipedia article on Ethiopia and saved its HTML.
2. Processed the text using spaCy and SpacyTextBlob to determine sentiment.
3. Identified the most frequent tokens and lemmas.
4. Created histograms to visualize sentence-level sentiment scores (for both tokens and lemmas).
5. Determined sentiment cutoff scores to select a subset of sentences for a summary.
6. Produced two summaries:
            - One using a token-based cutoff
            - One using a lemma-based cutoff
7. Compared the polarity scores and discussed the differences.

I have included the original HTML of the article (ethiopia_article.html) in the repository as required.
## Rubric

* (Question 1) Article html stored in separate file that is committed and pushed: 1 pt
* (Question 2) Polarity score printed with an appropriate label: 1 pt
* (Question 2) Number of sentences printed: 1 pt
* (Question 3) Correct (or equivalent in the case of multiple tokens with same frequency) tokens printed: 1 pt
* (Question 4) Correct (or equivalent in the case of multiple lemmas with same frequency) lemmas printed: 1 pt
* (Question 5) Histogram shown with appropriate labelling: 1 pt
* (Question 6) Histogram shown with appropriate labelling: 1 pt
* (Question 7) Cutoff score seems appropriate given histograms: 2 pts (1/score)
